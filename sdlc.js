// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "In this step you look for what is required to make a Minimum Viable Product or MVP. What do you need to make to get it out the door?"
const design = "Design is when you determine what algorithms/logic you need. It's also when you determine the look/feel of your product."
const implementation = "This is where the rubber hits the Road. It's time to get down and code. You build features."
const testingAndIntegration = "In this step you need to make sure your software works. Not only in the terminal, but in the field"
const maintain = "The software has released. Now it's time to chase bugs and implement feedback."
